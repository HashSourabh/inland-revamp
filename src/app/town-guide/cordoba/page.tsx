                                    is full of amazing architecture. The Mezquita (or mosque) attracts thousands of visitors each year who flock to admire the magnificent
                                    workmanship - it took two centuries to complete and is an amazing jungle of columns, recesses and arches with a church at its centre.
                                    Outside the mosque are the beautiful gardens, "the Patio de los Naranjos" and the "Calleja de la Flores".

                                    Across the river from the Mezquita is the Alc치zar (or fortress) which was built by the Christians in 1328 as a defence against the Muslims.
                                    It offers a lovely respite from the summer heat as you wander through the tree shaded gardens and courtyards.

                                    villages set into them. The Campi침a in the south which are the farmlands covered in wheat, vine and olive trees. The area is famous for
                                    its dry white wines, similar to sherry, which are produced from the Pedro Ximenez grape and olive oil, which is the other main produce
                                    from the region.

                                    vegetables and olive oil and are delicious and refreshing in the heat of the summer. Jamon, which is cured ham, Salchichon, a typical
                                    sausage, Ca침a de Lomo and Morcilla, black pudding are also widely enjoyed in the province. Some typical desserts are Alfajores, made of

                                    Cordoba enjoys its fiestas and festivals the same as every other town in Spain, and Semana Santa, or Easter week is one of the most
                                    important. There are no fewer than 32 processions in total with beautifully decorated and ornate pictures and figures of Saints accompanied
                                    by the Nazarenos (men dressed in typical gowns with hoods that cover all the face except the eyes). These processions pass through the town
                                    followed by crowds of people. In May there are three festivals; from 5th to 12th there is the Festival of the "Patios Cordobeses", a contest
                                    for the most beautifully decorated courtyard; the Cruces de Mayo is when the whole town is decorated with crosses and thousands of flowers;
                                    the last week in May is when everyone lets their hair down at the Feria de Cordoba - flamenco music and dance are enjoyed and the whole
                                    town revels in the festivities.
